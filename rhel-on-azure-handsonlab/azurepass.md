Azure Passes activation
======

In case you don't have proper paid Azure subscription, you will be provided *Azure Passes* by the lab instructor.

Azure Passes are temporary subscriptions provided to you to be used during this lab. They may be valid for some days or weeks after the lab and can be used to continue your learning journey.

In order to use Azure Passes, you are required to have a personal *Microsoft Account*, you *can't* use the passes with your *company account*. If you don't have a Microsoft Account you should create one now with e.g. your Hotmail or Gmail email address etc.

1. Log *out* from all Microsoft services with your browser. To do this you can go for example to: https://account.microsoft.com/account and log out.
2. Use your *private* Microsoft account on this page to claim the Azure Pass and to create a *new* Azure subscription: https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/
3. Login to https://portal.azure.com with the same private account and go to *Subscriptions*, you will see the Azure Pass subscription. Available credits will show *zero*, this is expected and normal.
4. Ready to go!
